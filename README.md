# Social-Network-API-

## Description


For this project, I was tasked with creating a the back end functionality for a social network api using the nosql database, MongoDB. The project also utilized the mongoose npm package to help with this functionality. The project needed multiple routes for GET, POST, CREATE and DELETE options as well having the functionality of user interaction through becoming friends and reactions to thoughts. The project functioned in that a set of models were created with database schema, controllers were used to create the function of how to interact with those models, and then routes were created to attach that functionality to API routes. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand how to create routes and functionality for the back end of an application using a nosql database such as MongoDB. I also wanted to improve my knowledge on the creation of database documents and sub-documents within a nosql database. Along with this, I also wanted to further my knowledge on how to use the ODM, Mongoose, to make the functionality of MongoDB easier to accomplish. 

## Installation

To install this functionality to the Social Network API, run npm run start in the terminal which will prompt the local host to listen on the specified port, and then attach the routes of the API to Insomnia where you can test how the routes return, update, or delete different database content.
